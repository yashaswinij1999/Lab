Do this after you do the IO Lab:

Common IO problems for which we need to know programming for:

1) WAP to read all content of a text file, given a path & then print to the monitor

2) WAP to take a search string & path as input & then print all the lines, line numbers of the lines that contain the search string.

3) WAP to read a file that contains one word per line & display it in sorted manner

4) WAP to edit a given input with another in a given path

5) A file contains student info. Each line contains 1 student info in this format name:dob:email:std:rank. Create a java menu
program to give the ability to the user to 
a) insert student records
b) search 
c) remove student
d) list students based on sorting by i) name ii) dob iii) rank

6) WAP to search all occ & replace it with another given the inputs

7) WAP to search for all occ of a given string, given a path(could be a folder too)

8) WAP to search for a given string, replace it with another only if it is a full word

9) A file contains huge numbers (could be decimal as well) per line. Find the average of the numbers.

10) Replace the contents of a file with the same content but in  sorted manner. Remove duplicates.
